# WebScrapingQuickRelease

This repo holds a web scrapper I created to scrape the company I work on, Quick Release. 

The data I scrape is from the Skills Matrix section. The Skills Matrix is a section where employees accredit different skills, so the information that contains is, for more than 350 skills (and therefore, more than 350 different URLs), the employee, the level of the skill, and the Business Unit they belong to. 

I wanted to get this data as a way of benchmarking my knowleged agains the overall of the company (for a progession interview process).

I am not including these analysis as it might contain PII data. However, I am also including a Word Cloud a included as part of the analysis and visualization on the data with the most important skills
